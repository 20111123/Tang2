            <p class="conteudos">
                The history of the Tang brand dates back to the 20th century and is
                closely tied to the development of instant flavored powdered beverages.
                Here is a summary of the Tang brand's history:

            <h1 class="titulos2"> Origin </h1>
            
            <p class="conteudos2">
                The Tang brand was developed by the General Foods Corporation (now part
                of the Kraft Heinz Company) and was first introduced to the market in 1957.
                It was created by William A. Mitchell, a food chemist who also invented other
                popular products like Cool Whip and Pop Rocks.
            </p>
            
            <p class="conteudos3">    
                The idea behind Tang was to create a powdered beverage that could be easily
                mixed with water, providing a pleasant and nutritious flavor. Initially,
                Tang was marketed as a vitamin C-rich drink, intended to help prevent vitamin
                deficiency.

            <h1 class="titulos3"> Popularity </h1>

            <p class="conteudos4">
                The popularity of Tang took off in the 1960s, partly due to its association with
                NASA (United States National Aeronautics and Space Administration). During the manned
                space missions of the Gemini and Apollo programs, Tang was used as one of the beverages
                astronauts could consume in space. This led to a lasting association between the Tang
                brand and space exploration.
            </p>

            <p class="conteudos5">
                In the 1970s, Tang began to be sold worldwide, becoming a popular instant beverage in many
                countries. The brand expanded beyond the original orange flavors to include a variety of
                flavors such as lemon, strawberry, and grape.

            <h1 class="titulos4"> Importance of Tang </h1>

            <p class="conteudos6">
                Over the years, Tang underwent various reformulations to meet market demands and consumer
                preferences. New flavors and reduced-sugar versions were also introduced to adapt to health trends.
            </p>

            <p class="conteudos7">
                Even as decades passed, Tang maintained its presence in the market as an iconic instant beverage.
                The brand continued to be associated with the convenience and the citrusy, fruity flavor that made it
                well-known.
            </p>

            <p class="conteudos8">
                It's important to note that over the years, the Tang brand was also associated with memorable advertising
                campaigns that helped solidify its presence in the market. Although Tang faced competition and changes in
                consumer preferences, it remains a recognized brand in many places around the world.
